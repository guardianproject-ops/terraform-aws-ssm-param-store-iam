# terraform-aws-ssm-param-store-iam


This is a terraform module that creates a IAM role and policy that allows an EC2 instance to fetch SSM params that begin with a prefix. Also allows the instance to fetch its own tags.

## Introduction

This module:



## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-ssm-param-store-iam/releases).



```hcl
module "ssm_param_store_iam_role" {
  source          = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-ssm-param-store-iam?ref=tags/0.1.0"

  path_prefix = var.name
  namespace   = var.namespace
  stage       = var.stage
  name        = var.name
  tags        = var.tags
  region      = var.region
  kms_key_arn = module.kms_key.key_arn
}
```
